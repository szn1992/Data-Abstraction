Problem5:
There are two test files for the program, which are used to test the functionalities of two essential classes in this project, PopulationQuery.java and FindPopulation.java. 
Tests on PopulationQuery.java focus on checking command lines and user inputs. To check command lines and user inputs, we create helper methods in PopulationQuery.java that return true if the input satisfies the criteria. In TestPopulationQuery.java, we create different cases of command lines and user inputs for testing.
FindPopulation.java contains the code for every version of approach. Tests can be divided into 6 sectors: testing correctness of 4 corners on US rectangle, testing output of version1, version2â€¦version5. In addition to using the original CenPop2010.txt, we also create a small text file, test_population.txt, for testing. For each sector, we use multiple different cases to test, and these cases all include some boundary cases. For example, for version 3, 4, 5, the rectangle, which holds the values of W, S, N, and E that the user type in, its top could fall on the top boundary of the grid, its left could fall on the left boundary of grid, or they happen at the same time, these are all boundary cases that we test using different rectangles.
